Crash - A simple light crash sound - good for low impact collisions
Bf-109 Flyby - The first 7 secs are a good engine start up. Will crop and edit to make more spacey
plane.wav - A really good startup sound we could use off the start. I need to crossfade out the bird chirps though
Dialed In - A lower beat background track
Crazy Call at Cry - A more growly fast paced background track
